In Sprint 1 we created the first iteration of our prototype to test some concepts with our users, such as:

1. do they prefer 'one thing per page' and
2. do they understand the 3 steps of validation

**NOTE: both these 'iterations' are based on our early assumptions. These were created in the first sprint before we had done any usability testing.**

##  Iteration 1

The first iteration of the prototype was based on flow put together by the previous service designer on the team.  We decided pretty early on that we needed to take a step back from this flow for a few reasons such as:

1. the flow included patterns which were not part of the GOV UK Design System and had no research to back up why the patterns had been changed
2. the flow wasn't following rules such as ['one thing per page'](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/03/one-thing-per-page/) without evidence to justify these choices
3. we needed to ad a 'Before you start' for each task

### Content changes

We made some content changes from the flow put together by the previous service designer. Without access to the test environment of the existing service, we relied on [an example scheme return page on the TPR website](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/-/media/thepensionsregulator/files/import/pdf/part-2-exchange-example-scheme-return-db-only-schemes.ashx) to give us some idea of the language that users would be familiar with.

We also reduced the amount of some text to decrease cognitive load.

##  Iteration 2

We chose to take a step back from the original flow which was based on assumptions. Before doing any usability testing with the second iteration of the prototype we wanted to know whether:

1. checking things using a ['one thing per page'](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/03/one-thing-per-page/) format worked for our users
2. users understood the uploading a file and the '3 step validation' of checking the information they were uploading

### 'One thing per page' format

We moved away from using a 'check your answers' style page per task to a one thing per page approached.
We wanted to test whether our users would prefer being asked one thing at a time, like 'Is this your scheme addresses? Yes/No

Our assumption, based on the research in Discovery, is that smaller actuary firms would prefer this approach.

### Declaration content

We copied the Declaration content from the bottom of the [example scheme return form](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/-/media/thepensionsregulator/files/import/pdf/part-2-exchange-example-scheme-return-db-only-schemes.ashx) into a page towards the end of the process. We chose this as we did not yet have access to the existing service, and we assumed that it would have been signed off from a legal perspective.

### Confirmation page

We used the GDS pattern for confirmation pages as we did not yet have access to any user research to suggest we do otherwise. We assumed we would be giving the user a reference number. We were deliberately vague about what happens next as this hadn't been mapped out yet at this early stage.

### Uploading a file and the '3 step validation'

A big issue identified with the old service in the Discovery research was that the information provided to TPR is either incorrect or not completed. Our assumption is a lot of this is from miskeying information from a spreadsheet into the service. We think that providing users with a spreadsheet template they can upload would work for our them, but this is an assumption we want to test.

#### 3 Step validation

We plan to put validation within 3 steps:
1. the spreadsheet, to make sure for example certain values add up  
2. front-end validation, for correct file type
3. scanning the spreadsheet on upload to check if there are any problems
