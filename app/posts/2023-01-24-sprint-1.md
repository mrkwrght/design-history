In sprint 1 we created the first iteration of our prototype to test some concepts with our users like Do they prefer 'one thing per page' and do they understand the 3 steps of valudation

NOTE: both these 'Iteration' are based on our assumptions these were created in the first sprint before we had done any usablity testing.

##  Iteration 1

the first iteration of the prototype was based on flow put together by the previous service designer on the team,  we decided pretty earlier that we needed to take a step back from this flow for a few reasons such as:
1. the flow included pattern which were not part of the GOV UK Design System and had no research to back up why the patterns had been changed
2. the flow wasn't following rules such as ['one thing per page'](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/03/one-thing-per-page/) without evidence to justify these choices
3. Before you start for each task

##  Iteration 2

we choices to take a step back from the original flow which was based on assumptions before doing any usability testing

with the second iteration of the prototype we wanted to weather:

1. checking things using a ['one thing per page'](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/03/one-thing-per-page/) format worked for our users
2. users understood the uploading a file and the '3 step validation' of checking the information they were uploading

### 'One thing per page' format

we moved away from using a 'check your answers' style page per task to a one thing per page approached.
we wanted to test weather our users would prefer being asked one thing at a time like 'Is this your scheme addresses? Yes/No

our assumption being that smaller actuary firms would prefer this because of the discovery research.

### Uploading a file and the '3 step validation'

a big issues identified with the old service via the discovery research was that the information provided to TPR is either incorrect or not completed our assumption is a lot of this is from miss keying information from a spreadsheet into the service which is why we think that providing with a spreadsheet template they can upload would work for our users but this is an assumption we want to test.

#### 3 Step validation

we plan to put validation within 3 steps:
1. the spreadsheet to make sure for example certain values add up  
2. front-end validation, for correct file type
3. scanning the spreadsheet on upload to check if there is any problems
