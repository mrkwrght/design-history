In Sprint 7 we had a mock assessment with DWP SSAAT. This is breakdown of the asssessment report.


##  Summary

In summary, moving forward the SYSVD team need to:

1. Conduct more research with:
- junior actuaries
- trustees


2. Continue to iterate the prototype
- create and test a version of the template with all SOS data items
- look into and better understand the ways into the service (sign in)

3. Look into data from the current service about devices used

## To be raised with the panel

Although we agree that the team need to look further into the ways into the service ,according to the Service Manual we do not need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works">understand or prototype ways into the service in alpha</a>.

Questions were raised around technology choices which were made at an organisational level, and were out of the control of the service team.

Significant questions were raised around how the service performance would be measured. The Service Manual only states that to meet the standard at alpha, 'you should... continue to refine the metrics you'll use to measure how successful your service is', and we do not agree that it was appropriate to spend such a significant amount of time on these questions in the assessment.


## Moving forward

SYSVD should stay in alpha and use the above recommendations to continue understanding the users and iterating the service nased on their needs.

Overall itâ€™s important for everyone involved to remember the amazing work which has been done in such a short period of time and with the challenges the team has faced.
