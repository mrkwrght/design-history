## Naming the service

The service was originally referred to as 'Data Validation Documents (DVD)' within The Pension Regulator.

During user research, we asked the participants how they would describe the task of submitting their pension schemes to TPR.

All participants suggested options that included these key words: 'submit your scheme valuation data'.

20% of our participants preferred the word 'information' instead of data because they define it as quantifiable facts, which is usually in numbers, while information is a mixture of numbers and data. However, the remaining 80% related to the word 'data'.

We've also asked our participants to give us their feedback on 'Report your scheme funding data' and we learnt that the term 'report' could be misleading.

 Someone said: "When you are reporting, it's almost like you've done something wrong, like when you do a breach report". The verb 'submit' was more prominent in our research.

As a team we are promoting to use the name suggested through our research - 'Submit your scheme valuation data'




## Accessible graphs

- Last sprint we explored some ways of playing back data to users.
- We spoke to ONS about playing back information in an accessible way, and how to make accessible graphs.
- User research indicated that users would prefer data to be played in a different format, but the graphs might be a reusable pattern for a future service.

## Accessibility Vs Usability

- The user with access needs had some suggestions to make the content more accessible for them.
- For example, they would have preferred more explanatory text.
- They preferred longer sentences. Instead of 'you'll also need' they felt 'In addition, you'll also need' was clearer.
- There is some conflict between changing content which would be more accessible for some users, but less usable for others. In general, more text = less clear, more cognitive load.
- The research identified content that could be clearer, and we are exploring ways to make it more accessible while remaining usable.
