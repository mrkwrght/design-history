In Sprint 6 we renamed the service and conducted research with an internal user with access needs.

## Naming the service

The service was originally referred to as 'Data Validation Documents (DVD)' within The Pensions Regulator.

During user research, we asked participants how they would describe the task of providing their valuation to TPR.

All participants suggested options that included these key words: 'submit','scheme' and 'valuation'. On this basis we devised two options for the service name - 'Submit your scheme valuation data' and 'Submit your scheme valuation information'.

20% of our participants preferred the word 'information' instead of 'data' because they define data as quantifiable facts, which is usually in numbers, while information is a mixture of numbers and written context. However, the remaining 80% preferred the word 'data'.

Using 'data' in the service name also made sense from a cognitive load perspective. It is shorter than 'information', and 'submit your scheme valuation information' contains two consecutive long words ending in '-tion'.

We also asked research participants to give us their feedback on 'Report your scheme funding data' and we learnt that the term 'report' could be misleading.

 One participant said: "When you are reporting, it's almost like you've done something wrong, like when you do a breach report". The verb 'submit' was more prominent in our research.

As a team we are proposing to use the name suggested through our research - 'Submit your scheme valuation data'




## Accessible graphs

Last sprint we explored some ways of playing back data to users. We spoke to ONS about playing back information in an accessible way, and how to make accessible graphs.

User research indicated that users would prefer data to be replayed in a different format, but the graphs might be a reusable pattern for a future service.

## Accessibility Vs Usability

We met with an internal user with access needs, who had some suggestions to make the content more accessible for them. For example, they would have preferred more explanatory text.

They preferred longer sentences. For example, instead of 'you'll also need' they felt 'In addition, you'll also need' was clearer. The addition of redundant text would not be considered 'good content design' in general, as it decreases clarity while increasing cognitive load. There is some conflict between changing content which would be more accessible for some users, but less usable for others. 

However, the research identified that some content could be clearer, and we are exploring ways to make it more accessible while remaining usable.
