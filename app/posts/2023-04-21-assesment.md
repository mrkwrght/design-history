In Sprint 7 we had a mock assessment with DWP SSAAT this is break down of the asssessment report


##  Summary

In summary moving forward the SYSD team need to:

Conduct more research
	- conduct research with junior actuaries
	- conduct research with trustees
Continue to iterate the prototype
	- create and test a version of the template with all SOS data items
	- look into and understand the ways into the service better (sign in)
Look into data from the current service about devices used

## To be raise with the panel

Although we agree that the team need to look further into the ways into the service according to alpha guidelines we do not need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works">understand or prototype ways into the service in alpha</a>.

Questions were raised around technology choices which were made at organisations level and out of the control of the service team

Service performanceccd 


## Moving forward

SYSD should stay in alpha and use the above recommend to continue understanding the users and iterating
Based on their needs

Overall itâ€™s important for everyone involved to remember the amazing work which had been done in such a short period of time and with the challenge the team has faced.
