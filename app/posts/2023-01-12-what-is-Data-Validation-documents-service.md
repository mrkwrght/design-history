Data validation documents (DVD) is a service which is being created to replace end of life system.

Actuaries have to update The Pension Regulator every 3 years with new financial information about the scheme and check weather information such as the trustees of the scheme are up-to-date.

For the purpose of this Alpha we are focusing on the 'Data capture' part of the actuaries journey.


## The users


The service has 3 key external users,

### Junior Actuary

### Senior Actuary

### Trustees

## Problem statment


How might we make it easy for DB pension schemes to submit accurate information to TPR so that they are in compliance with the PSA and minimise the need for rework, while enabling greater data-driven decision making to protect scheme members?


## The vision

“Our vision is to deliver digital services designed to support pension schemes in their duties to workplace savers. Our digital services will be user centred, comply with government service standards and reduce delivery costs. Through digital services, we will capture data which will drive the insight required to effectively apply our regulatory powers and to create meaningful intelligence based on market themes. Digital Service Delivery drives us to be an efficient, data-led and agile regulator, demonstrating value for money.”
