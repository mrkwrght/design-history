In Sprint 4 we held a design review with our design peers. We used a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPjQSFQQ=/?share_link_id=437514522958MIRO">Miro board</a> to demonstrate the service and collect their feedback. This post goes into detail about the feedback we have chosen to take forward.

## Moving 'before you start' pattern to before the tasklist

One of the main pieces of really insightful feedback was around moving the 'before you start' pattern to before the tasklist page. This section functions similarly to an 'eligiblity checker' to use the new service, and most people mentioned they would expect it to be at the start. This also feels like it sets the user up for how the rest of the service works.

Moving the 'before you start' pattern to the start of the service also meant that we could merge it with the 'This is a new service page', reducing the number of pages and cognitive load.

We have taken this feedback forward and changed this in <a href="https://tpr-dvd-prototype.onrender.com/version-3-2/new-service">v3.2 of the prototype</a>.

## Removing the 'change' link for scheme details

We learnt in this sprint that users will not able to change scheme details in our service, and that there is a different process for this. We therefore removed the options to change the details, and directed users to contact TPR before they can proceed.

It is likely that these interactions will be removed from the service altogether.


## Subheading on 'check your answers'

The check your answers page had a separate heading and subheading that both performed the same function. These were merged into one heading, so 'Check your answers before completing this section' and 'Scheme details' became 'Check your scheme details before completing this section'.


## Moving the declaration checkbox

The declaration page had a tick box that stated 'I declare that', followed by the the declaration text, and then a green 'Confirm and submit' button. We received feedback that other services had been asked to move the tickbox after the declaration text, so that users were more likely to read the text before ticking the box. We therefore moved the checkbox and altered the text accordingly.

## Upload button text

We received feedback that the 'Upload and continue' button on the 'Check your upload' page only made sense if you had uploaded the correct file. If you were selecting 'No, I want to choose a different file', then 'Upload and continue' did not make sense. We changed the button text to 'Continue'.

## Template download links

We inherited a template download link from the previous service designer, which read 'Download the template and instructions (2 files).' Based on feedback, we brought this in line with the pattern by splitting this into two separate links, including the file format and file size.


## Collaborating with other government departments

We reached out to the HMRC Managing Pension Schemes team around their file upload systems becasue theu have a very similar user base. It was useful to share reserach and patterns around how file upload works for them. We discovered issues they had with requiring uploads in a CSV format.

We also confirmed that if they only had up to ten errors, they displayed them all on one page. If there were more than ten errors, they played back generic errors that covered all of them. This is in line with our design which displays up to ten errors on one page, and just provides a download link if there are more then ten errors.

We plan to keep in touch with this team going forward.
