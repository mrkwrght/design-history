In Sprint 3 we iterated our prototype based on research findings from sprint 2.

These are the iterates we made

## Adding 'This is a new service' pages

In sprint 2 we also gained a wider understanding of where this service will fit in the wider journey becasue users will be access DVD from TPR exchange service which doesn't use GOVUK Design patterns we have choisen to add a 'This is a new service 'page to help users understand the change visually


## Adding 'What's your valuation data' and moving the template

In sprint 2 we understood better than the template used to upload data to service will need to be based on the valuation date because as policy changes in the future more things might be asked for based on this date.

we saw in research that several participants wanted the template as soon as possible so there could use this in their wider process so we moved the download of the template to early in the flow

## adding scheme name and PSR number

help users with lots of scheme

## changing information with TPR

removed address
added more 'real' data items

## upload your valuation results

removed details components based on confuse about it being a link
changed buttons to help reduce confusion around when a document is acutally uploaded
