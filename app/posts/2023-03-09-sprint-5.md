In sprint 5 we made iterations to the prototype based on the research in the previous sprint, and collaborated with some other government departments.

We experimented with using accessible graphs as a way of playing back uploaded data to users.

## Outcomes from the latest round of research

Last sprint we tested the prototype with 4 external actuaries. The main findings were:

- All participants found asking to check scheme details on single pages frustrating and questioned why this was a part of the service
- Most participants found it helpful to have a table of errors on 'there is a problem with your file'
- Most participants found it helpful to have a split between 'errors' and 'items to be checked' on 'there is a problem with your file' 


## Changing the 'check your scheme details'

In the last round of research, all participants found it frustrating when we checked one scheme detail per page. We have moved to checking all scheme details on one page.

We believe from user research that our service is not the right place to ask users to check their scheme details, however we want to conduct more research and gain a better understanding before removing the 'check your scheme details' flow entirely.

## Removing the declaration checkbox

We made the decision to remove the checkbox from the declaration page, to be in keeping with the<a href ="https://design-system.dwp.gov.uk/patterns/make-a-declaration">DWP Design System pattern on making a declaration</a> which does not include this component.

## Collaborating with other government departments

Last sprint we spoke with the HMRC Managing Pension Schemes team around their file upload systems and our similar user bases.

This sprint, one of the design challenges we looked it was how to play back lots of data that a user has uploaded. For example, with the 'cashflow' data we are asking users to upload 500 data items, so a traditional 'check your answers' page seems inappropriate. It also seems inappropriate to provide a file for users to download the answers that they have just uploaded.

We reached out to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) which have <a href="https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/">some good guidance around presenting data</a>.

One of the designers at ONS shared their work around accessible graphs using google charts.js with us, and this is something we want test with our users to see if it provides them with any value.
