In sprint 5 we made iterations to the prototype based on the research in the previous sprint and collaborated with some other government departments
Something about Graphs

## Outcomes from the latest round of research

Last sprint we tested with 4 external actuaries, this is brief synopsis of the outcomes:

- All participants found asking to check scheme details on single pages frustrating and questioned why this is part of the service
- Most participants preferred the version of 'there is a problem with your file' with table more useful


## Changing the 'check your scheme details'

In the last round of research all All participants found asking to check scheme details on single pages frustrating so we have moved to checking your scheme details on one page

we believe also that our service is not the right place to ask them to check their details but want to get more research and understanding before removing it entirely.

## collaborating with other government departments

This sprint we also reached out to HMRC and ONS

we talked and shared pattern with the HMRC managing pension scheme team which had done something similar to us around validating the file has been uploaded. this
conversation was useful as we feel their might be some overlap in our user base.

One of design challenges we looked at this sprint was how visualise lots of data that a user has uploaded. we reached out to ONS which have <a href="https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/">some good guidance around presenting data</a>.

One of the designers at ONS shared their work around accessible graphs using google charts.js with us and this is something we want test with our users to see if it provides them with the value
